           Overview

===============================
           Purpose
===============================

The DOD publishes contract wins in monetary amounts greater than 7.5 million daily (Monday-Friday). This data has potential significance in stock breakdowns in that some of the money awarded quantities can have a long-term positive impact on an organization's bottom-line year over year and organizations exposure for repeat business.

This program was developed to efficiently increase identification of IT service contracting organizations that are beginning to gain more dominance and ground on industry beasts such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman.

Throughout the pandemic, we noticed an uptick in cybercrime which ignited an uptick in cybersecurity consultations. This presented an opportunity lesser recognized contracting companies to gain footing via subcontracting and prime awarding gigs on DOD contracts.

This script can currently assist in tracking the DOD in areas such as industry growth, tech focus, potential technical/managerial gaps, risk appetite to more cutting-edge technology and commercial solutions, identifying employment opportunities, and developing educated estimations of companies financials from a fundamental perspective.
