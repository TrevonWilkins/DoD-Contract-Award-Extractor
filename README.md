## OVERVIEW
DoDCAE is a program that extracts data points from over 14,000 Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. The collected data enables users to conduct trend analysis of investment, career, and technology trends in the DoD. My particular use case with this project is to correlate financial market events and defense data to provide up-to-date translation of government contracts awards and their effect on organizations financial solubility.

The save directory structure of the excel writing portion of the script will need to be altered to match the format of the Windows directory tree as opposed to the Linux directory tree.
